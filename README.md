Language Detection Using Python
This project detects the language of a given text using Python.
It uses a dataset called Tatoeba, which has many sentences in different languages.

Project Description
The project has two main models: FastText and XLM-RoBERTa.
These models learn from the dataset and can find out what language a text is written in.

How It Works
The data is cleaned and prepared for the models.
The models are trained on this data to learn language patterns.
The user can enter any text, and the models will predict its language.

Dataset
The dataset has more than 12 million sentences in over 400 languages.
We used only high-quality data and removed incomplete or wrong data.

How to Use
Run the main program file.
Choose the model you want to use.
Enter your text to detect the language.
The program will show the language name as the result.
